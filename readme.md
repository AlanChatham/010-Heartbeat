This piece uses a laser pointer reflected off a mirror attached to a spring attached to a speaker, which makes little patterns when sound is played. A microphone picks up the sound from outside the gallery, then the pd program amplifies the noise and shifts the pitch downwards.

A webcam (logitech webcam - model C270 - it's pretty great, but it's really important to install the Logitech drivers and run it on a PC to get the full 30fps framerate. Also, the tools to adjust the zoom and position and color settings of the webcam in software are super helpful, so I might recommend you use the same) then is pointed at the laser pattern, and draws out a pattern to be projected as a part of the piece, providing a 'heartbeat' of the city.
